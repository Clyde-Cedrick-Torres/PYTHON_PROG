    "# Q7  OOP Vehicles\n",
    "TASK: OOP: Vehicles with Odometer and Fuel. Design classes Vehicle (base), Car and Truck (children). Each has color, mileage, and fuel_liters. Provide drive(km, km_per_liter) which increments mileage and decreases fuel (never below 0) and refuel(liters). Show how inheritance avoids duplication and add a method override in Truck (e.g., different efficiency). Include a minimal test script. Anchor concepts: classes vs. instances, attributes, instance methods, inheritance/override. Reference: :contentReference[oaicite:13]index=13\n",

    "Design Vehicle with attributes color, mileage, fuel_liters. Methods: drive(km, km_per_liter) that consumes fuel and never lets fuel go below 0, and refuel(liters). Create Car and Truck subclasses; Truck should override drive to be less efficient (e.g., efficiency factor). Include a minimal test.\n",
